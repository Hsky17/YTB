# YTB
Simple yet feature rich youtube bot implementation for discord

## Disclaimer
This was made just for fun and for learning discord.py, code is unoptimized and unorganized at the moment as it was AI assisted and left as functional. Optimizations and fixes will come in the future but will only be pushed once in a while

# To-Do
- Add support for spotify links
- Add error handling (Partially)
- Add idle music logic
- - If a song is longer than 20 minutes long, it will play when no other song is playing. But when a song gets requested, it will take priority and pause the idle music.

# Known bugs
- Users not being assigned correctly

# Installation
There is a wiki page on installing and running the bot [here](https://github.com/Hsky17/YTB/wiki/Installation)
